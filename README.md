# **Visualizing the Napoleon's march** - Learning Data Visualization with R

Welcome to the "**Visualizing the Napoleon's march**" repository! This project is about learn data visualization techniques using R by recreating the famous Napoleon's march plot originally created by [Charles John Minard](http://euclid.psych.yorku.ca/www/psy6135/tutorials/Minard.html).

## Overview

This repository contains the code and data necessary to recreate the iconic visualization of Napoleon's 1812 Russian campaign. The goal of this project is not only to replicate the visualization but also to understand the code!!.

## Contents

-   **Data**: The `data` directory contains the data file 'napoleon.rds', which includes information about cities, temperatures, and troop counts along Napoleon's march.

-   **Process**: In `napoleon-march.qmd`, you will find the qmd file that guides you through the process of recreating the visualization step by step.

-   **Output**: In `napoleon-march.html`, you will find the html file that was rendered from the qmd file.
